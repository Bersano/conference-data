I would like to suggest a new location for the validLocations file:

- country: `country you would like to add` (optional)
- city: `city you would like to add`

https://github.com/tech-conferences/conference-data/blob/main/scripts/config/validLocations.ts

If you would like to suggest a conference, please also list the details of the conference here:
- conference name:
- url:
- date:
- cfp:
- cfp url:
- topic:
- language:
- is the conference onsite or hybrid?
- bluesky/mastodon/twitter handle
- code of conduct

Is there anything else we can help you with?
